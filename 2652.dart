// This Dart program finds the sum of all numbers from 1 to n that are divisible by 3, 5, or 7.
// Inside the sumOfMultiples function, a loop runs from 1 up to n, and for each number, 
// it checks whether itâ€™s a multiple of 3, 5, or 7 using the modulus operator (%). 
// If the condition is true, that number gets added to the sum variable. After the loop ends,
// the total sum is returned as the result. For example, when n = 10, 
// the numbers divisible by 3, 5, or 7 are 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 10, and their total is 40, which is the output.
