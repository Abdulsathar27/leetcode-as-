// This Dart code implements a sliding window approach to find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. 
// It uses a count array to keep track of character frequencies within the current window, defined by pointers i (start) and j (end). 
// As the window expands by incrementing j, if a character at s[j] is already present (its count becomes greater than 1), 
// the window shrinks from the left by incrementing i and decrementing the count of s[i] until the duplicate is removed.
// At each step, the answer is updated with the maximum length of the valid (no repeating characters) substring found so far, calculated as jâˆ’i+1.
